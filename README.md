# Maestral-WebApp-SWE
Software Engineering and Analysis Project
<p>This is a Project on Software Engineering and Analysis course when we worked on about building a software managment system 
for "Maestral Hotel in Sarande".The Hotel Management System Web Application is a comprehensive software solution 
designed to streamline and enhance the operations of a hotel. The overall management of 
different hotel processes, customer satisfaction, and efficiency are the goals of this web-based 
platform. Important features including guest services, billing, reporting, room assignment, 
and reservation management will all be covered by the system.</p>
<p></p>Maestral software is a technological advancement that enables hotel operators and owners to 
increase both short- and long-term bookings while streamlining their administrative duties.
Maestral is an essential component of the entire visitor experience, not just for daily 
operations. 
The hotel management technology must improve the customer experience from the start of 
the online booking process to the end of the stay and the guests' feedback when they get back 
home.</p>
<p>The goal of this product is to unite all potential Sandri's and Riaâ€™s Kolagji Hotel stakeholders 
while providing flexibility and streamlining the management process. The primary goals of 
the product are reliability and ease of use.</p>
